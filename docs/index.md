This section aims to be a comprehensive guide to Machinekit. We’ll cover topics such
as downloading and installing pre-built images for computers like the Beaglebone Black or 
Linux computer, getting up and running with your machine tool, customizing your installation
for the hardware you have, and participating in the ongoing development of 
Machinekit.

## About this documentation

Motion control software is a complicated thing, made more complicated by the fact that every machine
is different, with its own personality and quirks. While we will try to cover the most common uses of Machinekit in this documentation, you are sure to encounter situations not covered. When that happens, reach out to the community, through the forums ((LINK!)) or the ((LINK!)) Contact page of this website.

If you come across anything along the way that we haven’t covered, or if you
know of a tip you think others would find handy, please [file an
issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) and we’ll see about
including it in this guide.
